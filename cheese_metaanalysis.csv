Lopez; Arteaga-Garibay, Ramon I.",Bacterial Succession through the Artisanal Process and Seasonal Effects Defining Bacterial Communities of Raw-Milk Adobera Cheese Revealed by High Throughput DNA Sequencing,MICROORGANISMS,"The bacterial community of the artisanal Adobera cheese from Los Altos de Jalisco was described through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries. Samples were collected in two different seasons (dry and rainy) during four key steps of the manufacturing process (raw milk, fresh curd, matured curd, and cheese). Bacterial diversity was higher in early steps in comparison with the final elaboration stages. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla, strongly represented by the Streptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae families, and core bacteria genera such as Streptococcus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. Undesirable bacteria, including Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., were also detected in raw milk but almost undetectable at the end of the cheese manufacturing process, and seemed to be displaced by lactic-acid bacteria-related genera. Seasonal effects were observed on the community structure but did not define the core microbiota composition. Predictive metabolism was related to membrane transport, and amino-acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Our results contribute to deduce the role of bacteria involved in Adobera cheese manufacturing in terms of the metabolism involved, cheese microbial safety, and how undesirable bacterial populations could be regulated by process standardization as a potential tool to improve safety.",,"Anaya Esparza, Luis Miguel/0000-0001-9194-1719; ARTEAGA, RAMON/0000-0002-5745-8149",,2076-2607,JAN,2021,9,1,10.3390/microorganisms9010024,33374626,16S RNA sequencing,Yes,Whole,No,"Raw milk (RM), fresh curd (FC), acidified curd (MC), and cheese (CH)",0.2,PRJNA681198,NA,Dry (November to May) and rainy seasons (June to October),Yes,Whole mass,No,YES,NA,NA,NA,Mexico,NA,Artisanal Adobera,NA,Ripened,Industrial,No,No,NA

M.; Saavedra, L.",Metagenomics-based approach for studying and selecting bioprotective strains from the bacterial community of artisanal cheeses,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY,"A metagenome-based approach was used to assess the taxonomic affiliation and functional potential for bacteriocin production of the bacterial community in cow's milk artisanal cheeses from Northwestern Argentina. Three different samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics. Taxonomic analysis showed that cheese A and C were quite similar whereas cheese B displayed a rather different bacterial composition. Overall, two families, Streptococceae and Enterococceae, dominated the artisanal cheese microbiota, being the former family prevalent in cheese B and the later family the most important in samples A and C. Besides the usual species associated to cheeses, a number of bacterial taxa that have not been previously found in Argentinean artisanal cheeses were reported in the present work such as Macrococcus caseolyticus and Streptococcus macedonicus Functional metagenomics analysis using the bacteriocin mining software BAGEL3, identified 2 ORFs encoding antimicrobial peptides in cheese B and 42 different peptides in sample C. The bacteriocin genes found showed good correlation with taxonomy. Based on the microbial diversity and functional features found through shotgun metagenomic sequencing, a culture-dependent approach was applied aiming to isolate bacteriocin-producing bacteria able to inhibit the growth of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. From 151 bacterial colonies derived from the cheese samples, 10 were associated to high anti-Listeria activity. Based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and RAPD-PCR analysis, all bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium. Finally, we carried out a pilot experiment with L. monocytogenes-contaminated cheese using one of the enterococcal isolates as a bioprotective adjunct culture. The use of E. faecium CRL1879 during artisanal cheese manufacturing did not alter the main organoleptic properties of the cheese and ensured an efficient control of the food-borne pathogen up to 30 days. This finding supports the use of E. faecium CRL1879 as an adjunct culture in the cheese-making process with a combination of both safety and minimal processing.",,"Weckx, Stefan/0000-0002-1380-8610",0168-1605,1879-3460,16-Dec,2020,335,,10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2020.108894,33032033,16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics,Yes,Whole,No,Whole mass,5,PRJEB24788-PRJEB24792,NA,NA,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Argentina,NA,Cow's milk artisanal,NA,Ripened,Commercial,No,No,NA

In this study, bacterial 16S rRNA-gene sequencing, untargeted metabolomics (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and data integration analyses were used to characterize and differentiate commercial Cheddar cheeses of varying maturity made by the same and different manufacturers. Microbiota and metabolite compositions varied between cheeses of different ages and brands, and could be used to distinguish the cheeses. Individual amino acids and carboxylic acids were positively correlated with the ripening age for some brands. Integration and Random Forest analyses revealed numerous associations between specific bacteria and metabolites including a previously undescribed positive correlation between Thermus and phenylalanine and a negative correlation between Streptococcus and cholesterol. Together these results suggest that multi-omics analyses has the potential to be used for better understanding the relationships between cheese microbiota and metabolites during ripening and for discovering biomarkers for validating cheese age and brand authenticity.",,"afshari, roya/0000-0002-7455-8731",1664-302X,,26-Nov,2020,11,,10.3389/fmicb.2020.592060,33324371,16S rRNA-gene,Yes,Whole,No,Whole mass,0.2,PRJNA673975.,NA,3 brands at different maturities were sampled ,Yes,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Australia,NA,Cheddar,NA,Ripened,Commercial,NA,NA,16S rRNA

The samples for analyses were collected in spring and autumn. Spring samples were characterized by significantly higherLactococcusandBacilluscounts and lower counts of Enterobacteriaceae,Enterococcus, and yeasts than autumn samples. The predominant microorganisms identified by the Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology belonged to four phyla: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The dominant species were starter culture bacteria.Lactobacillus rhamnosus,Lactobacillus kefiri,Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens,Lactobacillus casei,Streptococcus thermophilus, andBifidobacteriumhad the highest share of microbial cheese communities. The number of gamma-Proteobacteria reads was higher in autumn cheese samples. A high number of reads was also noted in the genusClostridium. The counts of spore-forming bacteria of the genusBacilluswere higher in cheeses produced in spring. The study revealed highly similar relationships between the analyzed production periods.

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) was applied in the present research to characterize traditional Cyprus Halloumi bacterial diversity. Eighteen samples made by different milk mixtures and produced in different areas of the country were analyzed, to reveal that Halloumi's microbiome was mainly comprised by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus, as well as halophilic bacteria, such as Marinilactibacillus and Halomonas. Additionally, spore forming bacteria and spoilage bacteria, were also detected. Halloumi produced with the traditional method, had significantly richer bacterial diversity compared to Halloumi produced with the industrial method. Variations detected among the bacterial communities highlight the contribution of the initial microbiome that existed in milk and survived pasteurization, as well as factors associated with Halloumi manufacturing conditions, in the final microbiota composition shaping. Identification and characterization of Halloumi microbiome provides an additional, useful tool to characterize its typicity and probably safeguard it from fraud products that may appear in the market. Also, it may assist producers to further improve its quality and guarantee consumers' safety.","Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios A./AAG-2601-2021","Anagnostopoulos, Dimitrios A./0000-0001-9867-2291; Kamilari, Eleni/0000-0002-2473-9729; Papademas, Photis/0000-0003-0284-2247",0023-6438,1096-1127,MAY,2020,126,,10.1016/j.lwt.2020.109298,,16S rRNA gene sequencing,Yes,Whole,No,Whole mass,20,PRJNA598815,NA,Cheeses were at production sites and markets,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Cyprus,NA,Cyorus Halloumi,NA,Ripened,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this work was to gain insights on the microbiota of Paipa cheese by using a culture -independent approach. Method: two batches of Paipa cheese from three formal producers were sampled during ripening for 28 days. Total DNA from the cheese samples was used to obtain 16S rRNA gene sequences by using Illumina technology. Results: Firmicutes was the main phylum found in the cheeses (relative abundances: 59.2-82.0%), followed by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Lactococcus was the main genus, but other lactic acid bacteria (Enterococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus) were also detected. Stapylococcus was also relevant in some cheese samples. The most important Proteobacteria were Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonadaceae and Moraxellaceae. Enterobacter and Enterobacteriaceae (others) were detected in all cheese samples. Serratia and Citrobacter were detected in some samples. Aeromonas and Acinetobacter were also relevant. Other minor genera detected were Marinomonas, Corynebacterium 1 and Chryseobacterium. The principal coordinates analysis suggested that there were producer-dependent differences in the microbiota of Paipa cheeses. Conclusions: lactic acid bacteria are the main bacterial group in Paipa cheeses. However, other bacterial groups, including spoilage bacteria, potentially toxin producers, and bacteria potentially pathogenic to humans and/or prone to carry antimicrobial resistance genes are also relevant in the cheeses.","Lucas R, Rosario Lucas Lopez/I-4855-2018","Lucas R, Rosario Lucas Lopez/0000-0002-0180-9296; Castellanos-Rozo, Jose/0000-0001-7497-5917",,2076-2607,FEB,2020,8,2,10.3390/microorganisms8020218,32041151,16S rRNA sequencing,Yes,Whole,No,Radial slices (ca. 100 g weight each),0.25,PRJEB36556.,NA,"0, 10, 21 and 28 days of ripening.",Yes,Whole mass,Yes,Yes,NA,NA,NA,Colombia,NA,Paipa cheese,NA,Ripening,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

Analyses included physicochemical and biochemical composition, microbial counts, 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding and metatranscriptomic analysis, volatile aroma compounds and sensory analysis. Regarding soft cheeses, the salt content of cheeses affected proteolysis at 21 days of ripening. RNA sequencing revealed that the relative activity of G. candidum increased, whereas that of P. camemberti decreased in reduced salt cheeses in comparison to the controls. Higher global intensity of odor and taste was observed in cheeses with reduced salt content, consistent with higher levels of alcohol and ester components. Regarding semi-hard cheeses, modifications of salt content did not significantly affect either their biochemical parameters and sensory characteristics or their technological microbial composition at day 21 of ripening. Finally, no impact of salt content was observed on the growth of the spoiler Yarrowia lipolytica in soft cheeses.

Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides 2A, Lactobacillus casei 23C and Lactobacillus plantar= 18C (Autochthonous Starter, AS1) and Leuc. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides 2A, and L. casei 25D and 16A (AS2) were isolated and identified from aged ewes' milk PC cheeses, selected based on several enzymatic activities, and used as starter cultures. As shown by the in vitro kinetic of acidification, selected starter cultures had suitable capabilities to acidify. The manufacture of PC cheeses was carried out at an industrial plant scale. A control cheese (CC) was also made, using commercial starters consisting of mesophilic and thermophilic species. Ripening lasted 105 days at 10 degrees C. A poly-phasic approach was used to compare cheeses during manufacture and ripening, mainly based on pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA targeting DNA, proteolysis and volatile component analyses. Compared to CC, both autochthonous starter cultures slightly affected the gross chemical composition of PC cheese. The cell density of thermophilic starters of CC progressively decreased throughout ripening. Plate count and RAPD-PCR showed that the cell number of autochthonous lactobacilli cultures of PC cheeses, made with AS1 and AS2, was almost constant throughout ripening and abundantly higher than that observed in CC. As shown by culture-independent analysis, the OTUs found during ripening varied depending on the manufacture with or without autochthonous starter cultures. The major chemical differences among cheeses were the concentration of free amino adds and the synthesis of some key volatile components (e.g., 2-methyl-l-propanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol, isobutyric, isovaleric, and isocaproic acids).

In the present study, 15 Qula samples were collected from five different regions in China to investigate the diversity of microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. The bacterial diversity significantly differed among samples of different origins, indicating a possible effect of geography. The result also showed that microbial communities significantly differed in samples of different origin and these differences were greater at the genus than the phylum level. A total of six phyla were identified in the samples, and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria had a relative abundance >20%. A total of 73 bacterial genera were identified in the samples. Two dominant genera (Lactobacillus and Acetobacter) were common to all samples, and a total of 47 operational taxonomic units at different levels significantly differed between samples of different origin. The predicted functional genes of the bacteria present in samples also indicated differences in bacterial communities between the samples of different origin. The network analysis showed that microbial interactions between bacterial communities in Qula were very complex.

This study assessed the metagenomics of commercial Gouda cheese prepared using pasteurized or unpasteurized cow milk or pasteurized goat milk via 16S rDNA sequencing. Results were analyzed and compared based on milk pasteurization and source, spatial variability (core, outer, and under the rind), and length of aging (2-4 up to 12-18 months). The dominant organisms in the Gouda cheeses, based on percentage of sequence reads identified at the family or genus levels, were Bacillaceae, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. More genus- or family-level (e.g. Bacillaceae) identifications were observed in the Gouda cheeses prepared with unpasteurized cow milk (120) compared with those prepared with pasteurized cow milk (92). When assessing influence of spatial variability on the metagenomics of the cheese, more pronounced differences in bacterial genera were observed in the samples taken under the rind; Brachybacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, Yersinia, Klebsiella, and Weissella were only detected in these samples. Lastly, the aging length of the cheese greatly influenced the number of organisms observed. Twenty-seven additional genus-level identifications were observed in Gouda cheese aged for 12-18 months compared with cheese only aged 2-4 months.

The metagenomics of cheese is dependent on a vast array of biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors include the population of microbiota and their resulting cellular metabolism. Abiotic factors, including the pH, water activity, fat, salt, and moisture content of the cheese matrix, as well as environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and location of aging), influence the biotic factors. This study assessed the metagenomics of commercial Gouda cheese prepared using pasteurized or unpasteurized cow milk or pasteurized goat milk via 16S rDNA sequencing. Results were analyzed and compared based on milk pasteurization and source, spatial variability (core, outer, and under the rind), and length of aging (2-4 up to 12-18 months). The dominant organisms in the Gouda cheeses, based on percentage of sequence reads identified at the family or genus levels, were Bacillaceae, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus. More genus- or family-level (e.g. Bacillaceae) identifications were observed in the Gouda cheeses prepared with unpasteurized cow milk (120) compared with those prepared with pasteurized cow milk (92). When assessing influence of spatial variability on the metagenomics of the cheese, more pronounced differences in bacterial genera were observed in the samples taken under the rind; Brachybacterium, Pseudoalteromonas, Yersinia, Klebsiella, and Weissella were only detected in these samples. Lastly, the aging length of the cheese greatly influenced the number of organisms observed. Twenty-seven additional genus-level identifications were observed in Gouda cheese aged for 12-18 months compared with cheese only aged 2-4 months.

Substantial efforts have been undertaken to disclose the genetic repertoire of all members of the genus Lactobacillus, and yet their species-level profiling in complex matrices is still undeveloped due to the poor phylotype resolution of profiling approaches based on the 16S rRNA gene. To overcome this limitation, an internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based profiling method was developed to accurately profile lactobacilli at the species level. This approach encompasses a genus-specific primer pair combined with a database of ITS sequences retrieved from all available Lactobacillus genomes and a script for the QIIME software suite that performs all required steps to reconstruct a species-level profile. This methodology was applied to several environments, i.e., human gut and vagina and the ceca of free-range chickens, as well as whey and fresh cheese. Interestingly, the data collected confirmed a relevant role of lactobacilli present in functional and fermented foods in defining the population harbored by the human gut, while, unsurprisingly perhaps, the ceca of free-range chickens were observed to be dominated by lactobacilli characterized in birds living in natural environments. Moreover, vaginal swabs confirmed the existence of previously hypothesized community state types, while analysis of whey and fresh cheese revealed a dominant presence of single Lactobacillus species used as starters for cheese production. Furthermore, application of this ITS profiling method to a mock Lactobacillus community allowed a minimal resolution level of <0.006 ng/mu l. IMPORTANCE The genus Lactobacillus is a large and ubiquitous taxon of high scientific and commercial relevance. Despite the fact that the genetic repertoire of Lactobacillus species has been extensively characterized, the ecology of this genus has been explored by metataxonomic techniques that are accurate down to the genus or phylogenetic group level only. Thus, the distribution of lactobacilli in environmental or processed food samples is relatively unexplored. The profiling protocol described here relies on the use of the internal transcribed spacer to perform an accurate classification in a target population of lactobacilli with a <0.006-ng/mu l sensitivity. This approach was used to analyze five sample types collected from both human and animal host-associated microbiota, as well as from the cheese production chain. The availability of a tool for species-level profiling of lactobacilli may be highly useful for both academic research and a wide range of industrial applications.","ventura, marco/M-8230-2015; Turroni, Francesca/K-9660-2016; Duranti, Sabrina/AAI-7916-2020; mangifesta, marta/AAW-1521-2020; Van Sinderen, Douwe/A-6778-2015; Milani, Christian/ABA-8160-2020; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina/A-6344-2016","Turroni, Francesca/0000-0001-5363-0231; Duranti, Sabrina/0000-0002-7724-5669; mangifesta, marta/0000-0002-0933-1071; Van Sinderen, Douwe/0000-0003-1823-7957; Ossiprandi, Maria Cristina/0000-0003-2642-3709",0099-2240,1098-5336,JUL,2018,84,14,10.1128/AEM00706-18,29728382,16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing,Yes,Whole,No,Whole mass,4-Feb,PRJNA434072,NA,1 day of ripening,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Italy,NA,Fresh Parmesan cheese,NA,Ripening,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

The two grazing systems studied (extensive vs. semi-extensive) had a greater effect on the microbiota of cow teat skin than on that of raw milks and cheeses. On teat skin, the relative abundance of several taxa at different taxonomic levels (Coriobacteriia, Bifidobacteriales, Corynebacteriales, Lachnospiraceae, Atopobium, and Clostridium) varied depending on the grazing system and the period (early or late summer). In cheese, the abundance of sub-dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) varied depending on the grazing system. Overall, 85% of OTUs detected in raw milks and 27% of OTUs detected in ripened cheeses were also found on cow teat skin. Several shared OTUs were assigned to taxa known to be involved in the development of cheese sensory characteristics, such as Micrococcales, Staphylococcaceae, and LAB.

To decipher the prokaryotic composition of the cheese smear microbiome, the surface of a semi-hard surface ripened cheese was studied post-ripening by culture-based and culture-independent molecular approaches. The aim was to detect potential bacterial alterations in the composition of the cheese smear microbiota resulting from cheese storage in vacuum film-prepackaging, which is often accompanied by the development of a surface smear defect. Next-generation sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed an unexpected high diversity of a total of 132 different genera from the domains Bacteria and Archaea on the cheese surface. Beside typical smear organisms, our study revealed the presence of several microorganisms so far not associated with cheese, but related to milk, farm and cheese dairy environments. A 16S ribosomal RNA based analysis from total RNA identified the major metabolically active populations in the cheese surface smear as Actinobacteria of the genera Corynebacterium, Brevibacterium, Brachybacterium and Agrococcus. Comparison of data on a higher phylogenetic level revealed distinct differences in the composition of the cheese smear microbiome from the different samples. While the proportions of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were increased in the smear of prepacked samples and in particular in defective smear, staphylococci showed an opposite trend and turned out to be strongly decreased in defective smear. In conclusion, next-generation sequencing of amplified 16S rRNA genes and 16S rRNA from total RNA extracts provided a much deeper insight into the bacterial composition of the cheese smear microbiota.

The NSLAB species Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lb. casei and Lb. paracasei are frequently found in GP, and form a closely related taxonomic group (Lb. casei group), making it difficult to distinguish the three species through 16S rRNA sequencing. SpxB, a metabolic gene coding for pyruvate oxidase in Lb. casei group, was recently used to distinguish the species within this bacterial group, both in pure cultures and in cheese, where it could provide an alternative energy source through the conversion of pyruvate to acetate. The aim of this work was to study the evolution of the metabolically active microbiota during different stages of GP ripening, targeting 16S rRNA to describe the whole microbiota composition, and spxB gene to monitor the biodiversity within the Lb. casei group. Furthermore, activation of pyruvate oxidase pathway was measured directly in cheese by reverse transcription real time PCR (RT qPCR). The results showed that Lb. casei group dominates throughout the ripening and high-throughput sequencing of spxB allowed to identify four clusters inside the Lb. casei group. The dynamics of the sequence types forming the clusters were followed during ripening. Pyruvate oxidase pathway was expressed in cheese, showing a decreasing trend over ripening time. This work highlights how the composition of the microbiota in the early manufacturing stages influences the microbial dynamics throughout ripening, and how targeting of a metabolic gene can provide an insight into the activity of strains relevant for dairy products.","Levante, Alessia/Y-3024-2019; De Filippis, Francesca/K-3816-2016","Levante, Alessia/0000-0003-1985-2863; De Filippis, Francesca/0000-0002-3474-2884; Lazzi, Camilla/0000-0001-5759-5154",0168-1605,1879-3460,18-Sep,2017,257,,10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.07.002,28735145,16S rRNA sequencing and spxB expression from cheeses RT-PCR,Yes,Whole,No,RNA-Whole mass,RNA-0.15,PRJNA294953,NA,"2, 6 and 12 months of ripening,",Yes,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Italy,NA,Grana Padano cheese,720,Ripening,Industrial,Yes,Local,NA

Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and RNA-based high-throughput sequencing were applied to profile microbial populations, while the enumeration of active bacteria was carried out by using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Three different cheese productions (named D, E, and F) collected in the same month from the same dairy plant were analyzed. The application of the qPCR protocol revealed the presence of 7 log CFU/ml of bacterial load in raw milk, while, during ripening, active bacterial populations ranged from <4 to 8 log CFU/ml. The natural whey starters used in the three productions showed the same microbiota composition, characterized by the presence of Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii. Nevertheless, beta-diversity analysis of the 16S rRNA sequencing data and RT-PCR-DGGE showed a clear clustering of the samples according to the three productions, probably driven by the different milks used. Milk samples were found to be characterized by the presence of several contaminants, such as Propionibacterium acnes, Acidovorax, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and NSLAB. The core genera of the starter tended to limit the development of the spoilage bacteria only in two of the three batches.

The basis for this phenomenon has remained elusive, despite decades of research. The bacterial composition of cheese containing the defect was compared to that of control cheese using 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing as well as quantitative PCR (qPCR). Throughout, it was apparent that Thermus, a carotenoid-producing genus, was present at higher levels in defect-associated cheeses than in control cheeses. Prompted by this finding and data confirming the pink discoloration to be associated with the presence of a carotenoid, a culture-based approach was employed, and Thermus thermophilus was successfully cultured from defect-containing cheeses. The link between Thermus and the pinking phenomenon was then established through the cheese defect equivalent of Koch's postulates when the defect was recreated by the reintroduction of a T. thermophilus isolate to a test cheese during the manufacturing process. IMPORTANCE Pink discoloration in cheese is a defect affecting many cheeses throughout the world, leading to significant financial loss for the dairy industry. Despite decades of research, the cause of this defect has remained elusive. The advent of high-throughput, next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the field of food microbiology and, with respect to this study, provided a means of testing a possible microbial basis for this defect. In this study, a combined 16S rRNA, whole-genome sequencing, and quantitative PCR approach was taken. This resulted in the identification of Thermus, a carotenoid-producing thermophile, in defect-associated cheeses and the recreation of the problem in cheeses to which Thermus was added. This finding has the potential to lead to new strategies to eliminate this defect, and our method represents an approach that can be employed to investigate the role of microbes in other food defects of unknown origin.","Giblin, Linda/P-2436-2016; O'Sullivan, Orla/ABE-5980-2020; Ross, Paul/A-7584-2015","Giblin, Linda/0000-0002-9354-3121; O'Sullivan, Orla/0000-0002-4332-1109; Ross, Paul/0000-0003-4876-8839; Cotter, Paul/0000-0002-5465-9068",2379-5077,,MAY-JUN,2016,1,3,10.1128/mSystems.00023-16,,16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing as well as quantitative PCR (qPCR).,Yes,Whole,No,Whole mass,1,PRJEB6952,Selective isolation and enumeration of microbes,Ripened,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Ireland,NA,NA,NA,Ripened,Industrial,Yes,Commercial,NA

The cheeses were clearly separated on the basis of the acidification methods. Cheeses produced with the addition of starters were dominated by Streptococcus thermophilus, but a variety of lactic acid bacteria and spoilage microorganisms appeared at low levels (0.01-1%). Cheeses produced by direct addition of citric acid were dominated by a diverse microbiota, including both lactic acid bacteria and psychrotrophic gamma-proteobacteria. For five brands the acidification system was not declared on the label: the microbiota was dominated by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (S. thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecicii, Lactobacillus helveticus) but a variety of other subdominant lactic acid bacteria, psychrotrophs and Enterobacteriaceae were present, with a diversity comparable or higher to cheeses produced by direct acid addition. This led to the conclusion that undefined starters were used for acidification. Both ordination methods and network analysis were used for the representation of beta-diversity: matrix cluster analysis, principal coordinate analysis and OTU networks uncovered different aspects of the microbial community structure. For three cheese brands both biological replicates (cheeses from different lots) and technical replicates (replicate cheeses from the same lot) were analyzed. Repeatability was acceptable for OTUs appearing at frequencies >1%, but was low otherwise.

In this study, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE), a quantitative Clostridium tyrobutyricum PCR and next-generation Illumina-based sequencing of 16S rRNA gene were applied to study 83 Grana Padano spoiled samples. The aim was to investigate the community of clostridia involved in spoilage, the ecological relationships with the other members of the cheese microbiota, and the effect of lysozyme. Three main genera were dominant in the analysed cheeses, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Clostridium, and the assignment at the species level was of 94.3% of 4,477,326 high quality sequences. C. tyrobutyricum and C. butyricum were the most prevalent clostridia. Hierarchical clustering based on the abundance of bacterial genera, revealed three main clusters: one characterized by the highest proportion of Clostridium, a second where Lactobacillus was predominant and the last, dominated by Streptococcus thermophilus. Ecological relationships among species were found: cheeses characterized by an high abundance of S. thermophilus and L. rhamnosus were spoiled by C. tyrobutyricum while, when L. delbrueckii was the most abundant Lactobacillus, C. butyricum was the dominant spoiling species. Lysozyme also shaped the bacterial community, reducing C. tyrobutyricum in favour of C. butyricum. Moreover, this preservative increased the proportion of L. delbrueckii and obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli and lowered L. helveticus and non-starter species, such as L. rhamnosus and L. casei.

To facilitate this, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to elucidate the microbial community dynamics of brine-salted continental-type cheese in cheeses produced early and late in the production day. Differences in the microbial composition of the core and rind of the cheese were also investigated. Throughout ripening, it was apparent that cheeses produced late in the day had a more diverse microbial population than their early equivalents. Spatial variation between the cheese core and rind was also noted in that cheese rinds were initially found to have a more diverse microbial population but thereafter the opposite was the case. Interestingly, the genera Thermus, Pseudoalteromonas, and Bifidobacterium, not routinely associated with a continental-type cheese produced from pasteurized milk, were detected. The significance, if any, of the presence of these genera will require further attention. Ultimately, the use of high-throughput sequencing has facilitated a novel and detailed analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of microbes in this complex cheese system and established that the period during a production cycle at which a cheese is manufactured can influence its microbial composition.","O'Sullivan, Orla/ABE-5980-2020; Giblin, Linda/P-2436-2016; STANTON, CATHERINE/A-9549-2015","O'Sullivan, Orla/0000-0002-4332-1109; Giblin, Linda/0000-0002-9354-3121; STANTON, CATHERINE/0000-0002-6724-7011; Cotter, Paul/0000-0002-5465-9068; Sheehan, Diarmuid (JJ)/0000-0003-1742-2827",0099-2240,1098-5336,APR,2015,81,7,10.1128/AEM.04054-14,25636841,16S rRNA sequencing,Yes,Whole,No,Internal (core) and external (rind [1-cm3 segment]) regions of the cheese.,1-Jan,PRJEB8181,NA,"1, 10, 40, 64 days ripening",Yes,"Core, Rind",Yes,Yes,10,NA,NA,Ireland,NA,continental-type cheese,40,Ripening,Industrial,Yes,Commercial,NA

The management of cattle farms in Aosta Valley calls for seasonal migration to high pastures during the summer and the concentration of calving during the autumn and the beginning of the winter. Based on cattle physiology and given to calving seasonality, three cow lactation phases i.e. post-partum, oestrus and early gestation, can be identified and an effect could be hypothesized on average milk composition and on cheese quality.

The aim of the present paper was to investigate the bacterial dynamics during Fontina PDO cheese manufacturing and ripening, in relation to the different lactation stages, in order to evaluate a possible correlation between microbiota and phase of lactation. For this purpose, microbial RNA analysis was carried out by RT-PCR coupled with DGGE and high-throughput sequencing. A good performance of the starter cultures was highlighted throughout Fontina PDO manufacturing and ripening; in fact, the starter prevailed against the autochthonous microbiota. Thus, the microbial activity, which was supposed to affect the final quality of Fontina PDO cheese, appeared to be strictly associated to the presence of the starter, which did not show any difference in its performance according to the different stages of cow lactation.

community succession and the related gene expression were analysed during ripening of a traditional

modulated ripening conditions and observed consistent changes in microbial community structure and
function. We provide concrete evidence of the essential contribution of non-starter lactic acid bacteria
in ripening-related activities. An increase in the ripening temperature promoted the expression of
genes related to proteolysis, lipolysis and amino acid/lipid catabolism and significantly increases the
cheese maturation rate. Moreover, temperature-promoted microbial metabolisms were consistent

Eight variants of reduced-fat cheese (fat concentration 34-51% lower than traditional full-fat Burrata cheese, used as the control) were obtained using: (i) semi-skimmed milk and reduced-fat cream alone (RC) or in combination with (ii) xanthan (RCX), (iii) carrageenan (RCC), (iv) starter E1 (RCE1), (v) starter E2 (RCE2), (vi) both starters (RCE1-2), (vii) E1 and xanthan (RCXE1), or E1 and carrageenan (RCCE1). Post-acidification occurred for the RCC, RCX, and RCE2 Burrata cheeses, due to the higher number of mesophilic cocci found in these cheeses after 16 days of storage. Overall, mesophilic and thermophilic cocci, although showing cheese variant-depending dynamics, were dominant microbial groups, flanked by Pseudomonas sp. during storage. Lactobacilli, increasing during storage, represented another dominant microbial group. The panel test gave highest scores to RCE1-2 and RCXE1 cheeses, even after 16 days of storage. The 16S-targeted metagenomic analysis revealed that a core microbiota (S. thermophilus, Streptococcus lutetiensis, Lc. lactis, Lactococcus sp., Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Pseudomonas sp.), characterized the Burrata cheeses.

Thus, horse milk cheese with unique nutrition and flavor, an increasingly popular local cheese of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China, is considered to have diverse and specific bacterial community. To verify this hypothesis, horse, cow, and goat milk cheese samples produced under the same environmental conditions and manufacturing process were collected, and the 16S rRNA gene was targeted to determine the bacterial population size and community composition by real-time quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing. The bacterial community of horse milk cheese had a significantly larger bacterial population size, greater species richness, and a more diverse composition than those of cow and goat milk cheeses. Unlike the absolute dominance ofLactococcusandStreptococcusin cow and goat milk cheeses,LactobacillusandStreptococcusdominated the bacterial community as the starter lactic acid bacteria in horse milk cheese. Additionally, horse milk cheese also contains a higher abundance of unclassified secondary bacteria and specific secondary bacteria (e.g.,Psychrobacter,Sulfurisoma,Halomonas,andBrevibacterium) than cow and goat milk cheeses.

In this study, the microbial compositions of different cheeses (Cheddar, provolone, and Swiss cheese) and cheese locations (core, rind, and mixed) collected from the Arbuthnot Dairy Center at Oregon State University were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA).

Streptococcus was observed to be the most abundant organism in provolone (72 to 85%) and Swiss (60 to 67%), whereas Lactococcus spp. were found to dominate Cheddar cheese (27 to 76%). Species richness varied significantly by cheese. According to alpha diversity analysis, porter-soaked Cheddar cheese exhibited the highest microbial richness, whereas smoked provolone cheese showed the lowest. Rind regions of each cheese changed color through smoking and soaking for the beverage process. In addition, the microbial diversity of the rind region was higher than the core region because smoking and soaking processes directly contacted the rind region of each cheese. The microbial communities of the samples clustered by cheese, indicated that, within a given type of cheese, microbial compositions were very similar. Moreover, 34 operational taxonomic units were identified as biomarkers for different types of cheese through the linear discriminant analysis effect size method.

Metagenomics data revealed that fresh cheese was dominated by Lactococcus followed by members of Enterobacteriaceae family and Pseudomonas. Similarly, Lactococcus was the most abundant genus detected in mature cheese (54 days and 120 days), regardless of the container's material. In both fresh and mature cheese, species of Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Lactobacillus, Flavobacterium, and Carnobacterium were detected. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxellaceae and Pseudomonadaceae in mature cheese ripened in stainless steel container seems to be numerically reduced after 120 days of storage compared to the cheese ripened in plastic container but not significant differences were observed (p > 0.05).

In this investigation, we paid attention to four genes [prtP (cell-envelope proteinase gene), pepX (X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase gene), pepN (aminopeptidase gene) and bcaT (branched chain aminotransferase gene)] responsible for the production of volatile aroma-active compounds from milk proteins by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). We studied the dynamics of these genes and their corresponding LAB host, during the maturation of a raw ewes' milk-based cheese, using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approaches. The transcriptome-oriented experiments included the analysis of total RNA (at three stages of cheese maturation) and also the construction of specific cDNA sub-libraries of the abovementioned genes. The proteolytic transcriptome analysis was supported by following the transcription activity of 16S rRNA gene and by metagenomic investigation. The combination of the described methods permitted to screen the dynamics of targeted genes throughout the cheese production. Lactococci were the major players in the LAB group, but the analysis provided also information on the role and properties of members of the genus Lactobacillus, such as Lb. rhamnosus, Lb. helveticus, Lb. pentosus, Lb. curvatus, Lb. parabuchneri, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. paracasei, Lb. fermentum and Lb. heilongjiangensis, proteolysis-related genes of which were active during cheese ripening.","Soltys, Katarina/W-1265-2017; Pangallo, Domenico/ABD-8710-2020; Soltys, Katarina/Q-6592-2018","Soltys, Katarina/0000-0003-3862-3329; Budis, Jaroslav/0000-0002-8667-6655",0740-0020,1095-9998,SEP,2019,82,,10.1016/j.fm.2019.03.015,31027801,"16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metatranscriptomics",No,Isolate,No,Whole mass,1,NA,NA,"4 h, 24 h (D1) and 8 days (D8)",Yes,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Slovakia,NA,Bryndza cheese,14,Ripening,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

These products are manufactured by shaping of pasteurized or raw cows' or ewes' milk-based lump cheeses after melting in hot water. Unsmoked versions of these cheeses from three producers were studied regarding the contents of microorganisms and volatile aroma-active compounds in four seasons during a year. Culture-based microbiological analysis was carried out using selective media. Because eukaryotic microflora was found to be negligible, culture-independent analysis was focused to prokaryotes, using 16S rDNA amplification coupled to high throughput sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Aroma-active compounds were extracted by headspace solid-phase microextraction and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography-olfactometry supported by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

The pH, salt content, arid moisture content were analyzed in addition to microbial testing including yeasts and molds, coliforms, lactic acid bacteria enumeration, and L. monocytogenes counts. The cheeses were also inoculated with a cocktail of 5 food and human isolates of food-borne outbreak-associated Listeria monocytogenes strains to evaluate how the differences between brands influenced Listeria growth. Three of the cheeses underwent additional genus-level microbial analysis using extracted 16S rDNA, allowing for phylogenetic analysis between bacterial taxa including diversity and relative abundance. We found little variation between the sampled QF pH (range = 6.62-6.82) salt content (1.53-2.01%), and moisture content (43.90-54.50%). Yeasts and molds were below the detection limit of enumeration in all of the cheeses and coliforms were below the detection limit across the first 3 lots, but were detected at varying levels in the fourth lot (>3.0 most probable number/g) for 3 of the brands. Listeria monocytogenes was not isolated after enrichment in any of the samples. All cheeses tested positive for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, with only 1 of the cheeses being labeled as produced with added cultures having substantial counts. Fourteen days after inoculation with L. monocytogenes, at least 2.5 log10 cfu/g of growth was found for all QF brands stored at 4 degrees C. Microbial genus analysis showed that, among the 3 brands, the microbial community was more similar within brand than when compared with the other 2 brands. Thermus, Anoxybacillus, and Streptococcus accounted for the dominant genera of brands A, B, and C, respectively.

Buryatian cheeses have maintained not only their unique taste and flavor but also their rich natural lactic acid bacteria (LAB) content. However, relatively few studies have described their microbial communities or explored their potential to serve as LAB resources. In this study, the bacterial microbiota community of 7 traditional artisan cheeses produced by local Buryatian families was investigated using single-molecule, real-time sequencing. In addition, we compared the bacterial microbiota of the Buryatian cheese samples with data sets of cheeses from Kazakhstan and Italy. Furthermore, we isolated and preserved several LAB samples from Buryatian cheese. A total of 62 LAB strains (belonging to 6 genera and 14 species or subspecies) were isolated from 7 samples of Buryatian cheese. Full-length 16S rRNA sequencing of the microbiota revealed 145 species of 82 bacterial genera, belonging to 7 phyla. The most dominant species was Lactococcus lactis (43.89%). Data sets of cheeses from Italy and Kazakhstan were retrieved from public databases. Principal component analysis and multivariate ANOVA showed marked differences in the structure of the microbiota communities in the cheese data sets from the 3 regions. Linear discriminant analyses of the effect size identified 48 discriminant bacterial clades among the 3 groups, which might have contributed to the observed structural differences. Our results indicate that the bacterial communities of traditional artisan cheeses vary depending on geographic origin. In addition, we isolated novel and valuable LAB resources for the improvement of cottage cheese production.",,"Jin, Hao/0000-0003-2965-0739; Pan, Lin/0000-0001-7793-3982",0022-0302,1525-3198,AUG,2018,101,8,10.3168/jds.2018-14403,29753477,16S rRNA and PacBio SMRT Sequencing,No,Whole,No,Whole mass,2,PacBio SMRT (mgp83644) and NCBI (MF784166 to MF784228),Selective plating and enumeration of LAB,NA,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Russia,NA,Cottage cheese,NA,Ripened,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of centrifugation of milk, as well as incorporation of high heat-treated centrifugate into cheese milk, on the microbial and volatile profile of Maasdam cheese. To facilitate this, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in combination with a selective media-based approach were used to study the microbial composition of cheese during maturation, and volatile organic compounds within the cheese matrix were analyzed by HPLC and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Both culture-based and molecular approaches revealed major differences in microbial populations within the cheese matrix before arid after warm room ripening. During warm room ripening, an increase in counts of propionic acid bacteria (by similar to 10(1.5) cfu) and nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (by similar to 10(8) cfu) and a decrease in the counts of Lactobacillus helveticus (by similar to 10(2.8) cfu) were observed. Lactococcus species dominated the curd population throughout ripening, followed by Lactobacillus, Propionibacteriurn, and Leuconostoc, and the relative abundance of these accounted for more than 99% of the total genera, as revealed by high-throughput sequencing. Among subdominant microflora, the overall relative abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto was lower in cheeses made from centrifuged milk than control cheeses, which coincided with lower levels of butyric acid. Centrifugation as well as incorporation of high heat-treated centrifugate into cheese milk seemed to have little effect on the volatile profile of Maasdam cheese, except for butyric acid levels. Overall, this study suggests that centrifugation of milk before cheesemaking is a suitable method for controlling undesirable butyric acid fermentation without significantly altering the levels of other volatile organic compounds of Maasdam cheese.","Lamichhane, Prabin/D-1958-2015; Kilcawley, Kieran/P-2093-2019","Kelly, Alan/0000-0003-2759-1587; Kilcawley, Kieran/0000-0003-4048-8883; Cotter, Paul/0000-0002-5465-9068; Lamichhane, Prabin/0000-0003-4658-4892",0022-0302,1525-3198,JUL,2018,101,7,10.3168/jds.2017-14180,29550125,16S RNA amplicon sequencing and volatile organic compounds determination,Yes,Whole,No,Whole mass,5,NA,Enumeration of Starter and Nonstarter Lactic Acid Bacteria and PAB,"1, 11, 41, 65, 97, and 180 d of ripening",No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Ireland,NA,Maasdam cheese,180,Ripening,Industrial,Yes,Commercial,NA

Samples of artisanal cheeses were obtained from markets in Conceicao do Araguaia and Redencao (Para, Brazil) over rainy and dry seasons, and their biodiversity was assessed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Mean counts of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in cheeses ranged from 7.32 to 8.84 log CFU/g, for both seasons. Members of genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Weissella, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, and Leuconostoc were predominant. The amplification of the 16S rRNA V6-V9 region, followed by a temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and sequencing of the TTGE bands revealed important differences in the microbial composition variability between samples from the two seasons and among cheese samples analyzed. TTGE showed the presence of microorganisms that are frequently found in cheese, such as L. lactis subsp. lards, as well as other non-usual species, such as Macrococcus caseolyticus and Corynebacterium variabile. Moreover, TTGE analysis revealed the presence of microorganisms that have been isolated from other types of foods (Paralactobaciilus selangorenses) along with some not usually found in foods, such as Exiguobacterium acetylicum, plus the presence of pathogenic microorganisms (Granulicatella elegans and Aerococcus sanguinicola). The present molecular approaches combined with culture-dependent methods provided a more detailed description of the microbial ecology of traditional cheeses from the Amazonian region in northern Brazil.","DELVAUX, JULIO CESAR/AAH-6576-2019; de Carvalho, Antonio F/E-8594-2013; Nero, Luis Augusto/G-7754-2014","de Carvalho, Antonio F/0000-0002-3238-936X; Nero, Luis Augusto/0000-0002-4954-5824",0963-9969,1873-7145,JUN,2018,108,,10.1016/j.foodres.2018.03.060,29735061,16S RNA sequenicng and Sequencing of TTGE fragments,No,Isolate,No,Whole mass,10,"NR024885.1, NR074941.1, N103918.1, NR0286682.1, NR028682.1, NR113585.1, R113585.1, NR113585.1, NR102874.1, NR025396.1 and NR075042.1",Selective plating and enumeration of LAB,"

Genomic DNA for amplification was extracted directly from raw milk, starter culture, cheese at different stages of production, fully ripened cheese, and from the cultured cells grown on various media. The outer rind was sampled separately from the inner white core and blue veins. A diverse microbiota containing Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Staphylococcus devriesei, Microbacterium sp., Sphingobacterium sp., Mycetocola sp., Brevundimonas sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus sp., and Kocuria sp. was detected in the raw milk using culturing methods, but only Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Enterococcus faecalis survived to the final cheese and were detected both in the core and the rind. Using PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the cheese process samples, Staphylococcus equorum and Enterococcus durans were found in the rind of prepiercing samples but not in the core and veins; after piercing, these species were found in all parts of the cheese but survived only in the rind when the cheese was fully ripened. Brevibacterium sp., Halomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Alkalibacterium sp., and Corynebacterium casei were identified only by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and not cultured from the samples. Brevibacterium sp. was initially identified in the cheese postpiercing (core and veins), Halomonas sp. was found in the matured cheese (rind), and Acinetobacter sp., Alkalibacterium sp., and Corynebacterium casei were also found in the prepiercing samples (rind) and then found through the subsequent process stages.

Cheese samples were collected from days 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 after the starting point of post-ripening. The bacterial and fungal compositions were analyzed with next generation sequencing targeting the 16S rDNA loci for bacteria and ITS loci for fungi. The amino acids contents were analyzed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography combined with UV detection. The fatty acids and the volatile components were analyzed by Solid Phase Micro Extraction followed by Gas Chromatography/Mass spectrometry. We found that Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Kluyveromyces and Torulaspora were the dominant cheese's population. Bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS) based correlation analysis between microbiota succession and flavor dynamics showed that bacteria made more contributions to flavor formation than fungi. Eight bacteria genera and seven fungi genera were determined as functional core microbiota for the flavor production based on their dominance and functionality in microbial community.

The food processing environment can act as a source of natural microbial inoculation, especially in traditionally manufactured products. Austrian Vorarlberger Bergkase (VB) is an artisanal washed-rind hard cheese produced in the western part of Austria without the addition of external ripening cultures. Here, the composition of the bacterial communities present on VB rinds and on different processing surfaces from two ripening cellars was assessed by near full length 16S rRNA gene amplification, cloning and sequencing. Non-inoculated aerobic bacteria dominated all surfaces in this study. VB production conditions (long ripening time, high salt concentration and low temperatures) favor the growth of psychro- and halotolerant bacteria. Several bacterial groups, such as coryneforms, Staphylococcus equorum and Halomonas dominated VB and were also found on most environmental surfaces. Analysis of OTUs shared between different surfaces suggests that VB rind bacteria are inoculated naturally during the ripening from the processing environment and that cheese surfaces exert selective pressure on these communities, as only those bacteria better adapted flourished on VB rinds. This study analyzed VB processing environment microbiota and its relationship with VB rinds for the first time, elucidating that the processing environment and the cheese microbiota should be considered as microbiologically linked ecosystems with the goal of better defining the events that take place during cheese maturation.","Rodriguez-Lazaro, David/B-4201-2013; Selberherr, Evelyne/I-3795-2014; Schmitz-Esser, Stephan/AAA-7287-2019; Hernandez, Marta/I-3276-2016","Rodriguez-Lazaro, David/0000-0002-8795-854X; Schmitz-Esser, Stephan/0000-0002-1907-0709; Hernandez, Marta/0000-0001-6914-9987; Selberherr, Evelyne/0000-0002-2253-5247; Quijada, Narciso M./0000-0002-1956-7205",0168-1605,1879-3460,21-Feb,2018,267,,10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.12.025,29291459,16S rRNA sequencing,No,Isolate,No,Rind,0.25,MF091711 to MF092719,NA,NA,No,Rind,Yes,No,13.5,NA,NA,Austria,NA,Austrian Vorarlberger Bergkäse (VB) is an artisanal hard cheese,540,Ripened,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

Curd and cheese at different ripening periods (0, 30, 60 and 200 days) from two independent dairies were analysed combining culture-based microbiological analysis, Length Heterogeneity-PCR and 16S microbiome profiling. The autochthonous starter determined higher lactic acid bacteria (LAB) levels for the first 30 days of ripening, without interfering with secondary microbiota that determines the tipicality of this cheese. Only a few genera and species persisted in the cheese despite the microbial richness of the curd. In addition, the high levels of different LAB reduced harmful microorganisms. The various analytic methods used resulted in discrepancies in the proportions of Enterococcus, Lactococcus and Lactobacillus spp., but the pivotal role of Streptococcus and Lactococcus genera was evident.

This study aimed to characterize the microbial diversity composition, and geographical distribution of artisanal Minas cheese, focusing on the characterization of its autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) microbiota. Artisanal Minas cheese varieties from Serro, Canastra, Serra do Salitre, Araxa and Campo das Vertentes were analyzed by culture-dependent (culturing and LAB sequencing) and -independent (repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (rep-PCR) and length heterogeneity-PCR, LH-PCR) methods to characterize the microbiota. The microbial counts were variable between cheese samples, and some samples presented high number of coagulase positive bacteria and coliforms that may be associated with hygienic issues. In all samples was observed a prevalence of LAB. 16S rRNA sequencing and rep-PCR of the LAB strains identified four genus (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus and Weissella), ten species and more than one strain per species. Lactobacillus was the most prevalent genera in all the cheeses. LH-PCR revealed a further six genera and ten species that were not identified by culturing, highlighting the importance of combining both culture-dependent and -independent methods to fully characterize microbiota diversity. Principal component analysis of the LH-PCR data and cluster analysis of rep-PCR data revealed that the artisanal Minas cheese microbiota was influenced not only by their geographical origin but also by the cheese farm. The lack of standardization in the milking and cheese manufacturing procedures between artisanal cheese farms could explain the microbial diversity.

They have a long history of production and consumption. The microbial compositions of RM, HC, and Jk vary greatly, and are influenced by their geographical origins and unique processing methods. In this study, 2 batches of RM, HC, and Jk samples were collected (April and August 2015) from the Zhenglan Banner, a region located in the southern part of Inner Mongolian belonging to the Xilingol league prefecture. The bacterial and fungal diversities of the samples were determined by 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis, respectively. A total of 112 bacterial and 30 fungal sequences were identified, with Firmicutes and Ascomycota being the predominant phyla for bacteria and fungi, respectively. Lactococcus and Lactobacillus were identified as the main bacterial genera, whereas Kluyveromyces was the predominant fungus identified in the 3 dairy products.

Total microbial DNA and RNA were extracted directly from fourteen fermented and unfermented foods, and domain A of the variable regions V1 and V2 of the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed through LH-PCR and PCR-DGGE. Finally, the outline of these analyses was compared with bacterial viable counts obtained after bacterial growth on suitable selective media. For the majority of the samples, RNA-based PCR-DGGE revealed species that the DNA-based PCR-DGGE was not able to highlight. When analyzing either DNA or RNA, LH-PCR identified several lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coagulase negative cocci (CCN) species that were not identified by PCR-DGGE. This phenomenon was particularly evident in food samples with viable loads < 5.0 Log cfu g(-1). Furthermore, LH-PCR was able to detect a higher number of peaks in the analyzed food matrices relative to species identified by PCR-DGGE. In light of these findings, it may be suggested that LH-PCR shows greater sensitivity than PCR-DGGE. However, PCR-DGGE detected some other species (LAB included) that were not detected by LH-PCR. Therefore, certain LH-PCR peaks not attributed to known species within the LH-PCR database could be solved by comparing them with species identified by PCR-DGGE. Overall, this study also showed that LH-PCR is a promising method for use in the food microbiology field, indicating the necessity to expand the LH-PCR database, which is based, up to now, mainly on LAB isolates from dairy products.

The unique characteristics of local artisanal cheeses are almost completely preserved. However, their microbial communities have rarely been reported. The current study firstly generated the Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing bacterial diversity profiles of 6 traditional artisanal cheese samples of Kazakhstan origin, followed by comparatively analyzed the microbiota composition between the current dataset and those from cheeses originated from Belgium, Russian Republic of Kalmykia (Kalmykia) and Italy. Results: Across the Kazakhstan cheese samples, a total of 238 bacterial species belonging to 14 phyla and 140 genera were identified. Lactococcus lactis (28.93%), Lactobacillus helveticus (26.43%), Streptococcus thermophilus (12.18%) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii (12.15%) were the dominant bacterial species for these samples. To further evaluate the cheese bacterial diversity of Kazakhstan cheeses in comparison with those from other geographic origins, 16S rRNA datasets of 36 artisanal cheeses from Belgium, Russian Republic of Kalmykia (Kalmykia) and Italy were retrieved from public databases. The cheese bacterial microbiota communities were largely different across sample origins. By principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), the structure of the Kazakhstan artisanal cheese samples was found to be different from those of the other geographic origins. Furthermore, the redundancy analysis (RDA) identified 16 bacterial OTUs as the key variables responsible for such microbiota structural difference. Conclusion: Our results together suggest that the diversity of bacterial communities in different groups is stratified by geographic region.

While whey dilution did not have any effect on the microbiota composition, scalding temperature was shown to influence the microbial dynamics during ripening. A higher abundance of Leuconostoc spp. and Lactobacillus spp. was detected during ripening under all cheese making conditions considered, most probably caused by an increase in Lactococcus cell lysis during ripening. The metagenomic approach determined that the microbiota metagenomes contained a high number of genes involved in the carbohydrate metabolism and, during ripening, an increased number of metabolic functions, such as carbohydrate and protein metabolism, was detected. This can be attributed to the growth of minor groups of bacteria present in the starter (Leuconostoc) and non-starter microbiota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Its sensory characteristics and safety are probably the result of the balance between microbial populations and their metabolic capacity. In this work, we studied the dominance and richness of the bacteria in the Cotija cheese microbiome, as well as their metabolic potential by high-throughput sequencing. By the analysis of 16S ribosomal sequences, it was found that this metagenome is composed mainly of three dominant genera: Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Weissella, and more than 500 of non-dominant genera grouped in 31 phyla of both bacteria and archaea. The analysis of single-copy marker genes reported a similar result for dominant genera, although with greater resolution that reached the species level. Pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Brucella or Mycobacterium were not found. The Cotija cheese microbiome has the metabolic capacity for the synthesis of a wide range of flavor compounds, mainly involved with the metabolism of branched chain amino acids and free fatty acids. Genes associated with bacteriocin production and immunity were also found. Arguably, this is one of the most diverse meta-genomes among the microbial communities related to fermented products.

Caciotta and Caciocavallo Pugliese cheeses were chosen as model systems. Mesophilic lactobacilli, cocci and, especially, thermophilic cocci were the most abundant cultivable bacteria found on equipment, which were located in the production area. According to cell counts, catabolic profiles of microbial communities deriving from equipment, and cheese core and rind differed. As shown by 16S rRNA targeted metagenomics, Streptococcus thermophilus dominated the communities from knife surface, brine tank, curds and core cheeses as well as it was the main colonizing bacterium from drain table, rinds and ripening room of Caciocavallo Pugliese cheeses. Compared to S. thermophilus, the other starters used (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus helveticus) showed low relative abundance in cheeses and/or colonization capability. A set of other genera/species, which varied depending on the equipment surfaces and cheese making, contributed to the formation of a rather heterogeneous house microbiota.

Culture-independent detection of microorganisms was obtained by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and pyrosequencing, using amplicons of 16S and 26S rRNA genes for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively. With minor exceptions, the results from the culture-independent analyses correlated to the culture-dependent plating results. Even though the predominant microorganisms detected with the two culture-independent techniques correlated, a higher number of genera were detected by pyrosequencing compared to DGGE. Additionally, minor parts of the microbiota, i.e. comprising <10.0% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were detected by pyrosequencing, resulting in more detailed information on the microbial succession. As expected, microbial profiles of the surface and the interior of the cheeses diverged. During cheese production pyrosequencing determined Lactococcus as the dominating genus on cheese surfaces, representing on average 94.7% 2.1% of the OTUs. At day 6 Lactococcus spp. declined to 10.0% of the OTUs, whereas Staphylococcus spp. went from 0.0% during cheese production to 75.5% of the OTUs at smearing. During ripening, i.e. from 4 to 18 weeks, Corynebacterium was the dominant genus on the cheese surface (55.1% +/- 9.8% of the OTUs), with Staphylococcus (17.9% +/- 11.2% of the OTUs) and Brevi bacterium (10.4% +/- 8.3% of the OTUs) being the second and third most abundant genera. Other detected bacterial genera included Clostridiisalibacter (5.0% +/- 4.0% of the OTUs), as well as Pseudoclavibacter, Alkalibacterium and Marinilactibacillus, which represented <2% of the OTUs. At smearing, yeast counts were low with Debaryomyces being the dominant genus accounting for 46.5% of the OTUs. During ripening the yeast counts increased significantly with Debaryomyces being the predominant genus, on average accounting for 96.7% +/- 4.1% of the OTUs. The interior of the cheeses was dominated by Lactococcus spp. comprising on average 93.9% +/- 7.8% of the OTUs throughout the cheese processing. The microbial dynamics described at genus level in this study add to a comprehensive understanding of the complex microbiota existing especially on surface ripened semi-hard cheeses.

Pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rDNA and Operational Taxonomic Unit-based (OTU-based) analysis were applied to obtain an overall idea of the microbiota in Pico cheese and to elucidate possible differences between cheese-makers (A, B and C) and maturation times. Pyrosequencing revealed a high bacterial diversity in Pico cheese. Four phyla (Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes) and 54 genera were identified. The predominant genus was Lacto coccus (77% of the sequences). Sequences belonging to major cheese-borne pathogens were not found. Staphylococcus accounted for 0.5% of the sequences. Significant differences in bacterial community composition were observed between cheese-maker B and the other two units that participated in the study. However, OTU analysis identified a set of taxa (Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Rothia, Pantoea and unclassified genera belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family) that would represent the core components of artisanal Pico cheese microbiota. A diverse bacterial community was present at early maturation, with an increase in the number of phylotypes up to 2 weeks, followed by a decrease at the end of ripening. The most remarkable trend in abundance patterns throughout ripening was an increase in the number of sequences belonging to the Lactobacillus genus, with a concomitant decrease in Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas. Microbial rank abundance curves showed that Pico cheese's bacterial communities are characterized by a few dominant taxa and many low-abundance, highly diverse taxa that integrate the so-called rare biosphere.

The specific microbiota of this cheese has never previously been fully explored and the use of raw or pasteurized milk in addition to starters is assumed to affect the microbiota of the rind and the heart. The aim of the study was to analyze the bacterial microbiota of Herve cheese using classical microbiology and a metagenomic approach based on 16S ribosomal DNA pyrosequencing. Using classical microbiology, the total counts of bacteria were comparable for the 11 samples of tested raw and pasteurized milk cheeses, reaching almost 8 log cfu/g. Using the metagenomic approach, 207 different phylotypes were identified. The rind of both the raw and pasteurized milk cheeses was found to be highly diversified. However, 96.3 and 97.9% of the total microbiota of the raw milk and pasteurized cheese rind, respectively, were composed of species present in both types of cheese, such as Corynebacterium casei, Psychrobacter spp., Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, Staphylococcus equorum, Vagococcus salmoninarum, and other species present at levels below 5%. Brevibacterium linens were present at low levels (0.5 and 1.6%, respectively) on the rind of both the raw and the pasteurized milk cheeses, even though this bacterium had been inoculated during the manufacturing process. Interestingly, Psychroflexus casei, also described as giving a red smear to Raclettetype cheese, was identified in small proportions in the composition of the rind of both the raw and pasteurized milk cheeses (0.17 and 0.5%, respectively). In the heart of the cheeses, the common species of bacteria reached more than 99%. The main species identified were Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, Psychrobacter spp., and Staphylococcus equorum ssp. equorum. Interestingly, 93 phylotypes were present only in the raw milk cheeses and 29 only in the pasteurized milk cheeses, showing the high diversity of the microbiota. Corynebacterium casei and Enterococcus faecalis were more prevalent in the raw milk cheeses, whereas Psychrobacter celer was present in the pasteurized milk cheeses. However, this specific microbiota represented a low proportion of the cheese microbiota. This study demonstrated that Herve cheese microbiota is rich and that pasteurized milk cheeses are microbiologically very close to raw milk cheeses, probably due to the similar manufacturing process. The characterization of the microbiota of this particular protected designation of origin cheese was useful in enabling us to gain a better knowledge of the bacteria responsible for the character of this cheese.","Taminiau, Bernard/E-8008-2017","Taminiau, Bernard/0000-0001-6456-329X; Daube, Georges/0000-0002-9282-8408",0022-0302,1525-3198,OCT,2014,97,10,10.3168/jds.2014-8225,25064656,16S rRNA sequencing,No,Whole,No,The hearts and rinds ,NA,NA,selective plating and enumeration of microbes,Ripened,No,"Core, Rind",Yes,No,NA,NA,NA,Belgium,NA,Herve cheese,NA,Ripened,Commercial,Yes,Commercial,NA

The number of presumptive mesophilic lactococci in raw ewes' milk was higher than that of presumptive mesophilic lactobacilli. The numbers of these microbial groups increased during ripening, showing temporal and numerical differences. Urea-PAGE showed limited primary proteolysis, whereas the analysis of the pH 4.6-soluble fraction of the cheese revealed that secondary proteolysis increased mainly from 45 to 75 days of ripening. This agreed with the concentration of free amino acids. Raw ewes' milk was contaminated by several bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria (68%; mainly Pseudomonas), Firmicutes (30%; mainly Carnobacterium and Lactococcus), Bacteroidetes (0.05%), and Actinobacteria (0.02%). Almost the same microbial composition persisted in the curd after molding. From day 1 of ripening onwards, the phylum Firmicutes dominated. Lactococcus dominated throughout ripening, and most of the Lactobacillus species appeared only at 7 or 15 days. At 90 days, Lactococcus (87.2%), Lactobacillus (4.8%; mainly Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus sakei), and Leuconostoc (3.9%) dominated.

This study used 16S and 18S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing to characterize the bacterial and fungal communities of seven pooled cheese rind samples taken in seven different ripening cellars of three Austrian dairy facilities. A total of 408 clones for 165 and 322 clones for 18S rRNA gene libraries were used for taxonomic classification, revealing 39 bacterial and seven fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Bacterial OTUs belonged to four different phyla. Most OTUs were affiliated to genera often found in cheese, including high numbers of coryneforms. The most abundant OTU from 16S rRNA gene libraries showed highest similarity to Halomonas. Young cheese rinds were dominated by Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria, particularly by Halomonas and Brevibacterium aurantiacum, while Staphyloccocus equorum was most abundant in old cheeses. The most abundant 18S rRNA OTU had highest similarity to the filamentous fungus Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Pairwise correlation analyses revealed putative co-occurrences between a number of OTUs. It was possible to discriminate the different cheese rind microbiota at the community-level by facility affiliation and ripening time.

Fifty-nine Lactobacillus isolates were cultured from the outer crust, blue veins and white core of the cheese and were speciated phenotypically and by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species detected with only two isolates identified as Lactobacillus brevis. Strains were typed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme NotI to examine their genomic diversity. Cluster analysis of PFGE patterns produced five major clusters which associated isolates with their sites of isolation within the cheese. One L. plantarum isolate from each cheese site was selected and evaluated for salt, acid, relative humidity, and heat tolerance to determine whether stress conditions within the isolation site selected their phenotype. D-72 degrees C values were 6, 13, and 17 s for strains from the crust, veins and core, respectively, suggesting strains on the crust may not have been able to survive pasteurization and therefore had been added post-pasteurization. All strains recovered from heat injury within 24-48 h at 4 degrees C. pH values of 3, 3.5, and 4 suppressed growth but strains showed a varying ability to grow at pH 4.5 and 5; isolates from the core (which has the lowest pH) were the most acid-tolerant. All strains grew at 3.5 and 5% salt but were suppressed at 10%; those from the crust (which has a lower water activity) were the most halo-tolerant, growing at 8% salt whereas strains from the core were sensitive to this salt concentration. All 57 L. plantarum isolates were examined for antimicrobial activity and variable activity against Lactobacillus pentosus and other genera was demonstrated; plantaricin EF genes were present in 65% of strains.

An initial screening for antimicrobial, proteolytic, and lipolytic capacities was done in 214 presumptive lactic acid bacteria isolates obtained from Chihuahua cheese manufacturing and during a ripening period of nine months. The antimicrobial screening was done by spot-on-the-lawn tests, using Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli as indicator microorganisms; proteolysis was tested in casein-peptone agar and lipolysis in Mann-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS)-tributyrin agar. More than 90% of the isolates hydrolyzed the casein, but only 30% hydrolyzed tributyrin; the inhibition of L. monocytogenes in the spot-on-the-lawn assay was used to select 39 isolates that had a bigger inhibition zone (>11.15 mm +/- 0.3) than the control (Nisin producer Lactococcus lactis BS-10 Chr Hansen). The selected isolates were grown in MRS to obtain the neutralized cell-free supernatants and verify their antimicrobial activity by agar diffusion and the percentage of growth inhibition techniques. The selected isolates were also growth in casein peptone broth, and the cell-free supernatants were used for the determination of antioxidant activity by the radical scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) techniques. The results were analyzed to identify similarities by cluster analysis, based on their antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities.

I.",Antagonistic activity of strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Carpathian cheese,REGULATORY MECHANISMS IN BIOSYSTEMS,"A promising area for improving probiotics is the search for new sources of strains and the development of complex preparations which would include different types of bacterial cultures that complement each other. Sources of selection may be traditional dairy products, in particular, cheeses made from raw milk. Wild strains can be endowed with antibacterial properties. The antagonistic action of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has long attracted the attention of researchers and scientists. The aim of the study was to investigate the antagonistic activity against pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms of LAB strains isolated from traditional Carpathian cheese. Three samples of cheese were selected for the research - one sample of brynza and budz (brynza before salting), made in the highlands of the Carpathians, and one sample of budz, made in the foothills. LAB were identified using classic microbiological and modern molecular genetic methods (RAPD-PCR, RFLP-PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing). The objects of our studies were five strains of LAB: Lactococcus lactis IMAU32258, L. garvieae JB2826472, Enterococcus durans FMA8, E. faecium L3-23, E. faecium IMAU9421. Technological parameters such as acid-forming activity of milk fermentation, resistance to high concentrations of NaCl and temperature optimums of cultivation were taken as the main criteria for assessing the suitability of LAB for inclusion in fermentation preparations. Antagonistic activity was determined by agar diffusion (agar well method) and optic density of test cultures using a Multiscan FC microplate reader (Thermo scientifi., USA) at the wave of 620 nm. There were four reference strains of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms were test cultures: Listeria monocytogenes PCM 2191, Staphylococcus aureus PCM 458, Escherichia coli PCM 2208, Salmonella typhimurium PCM 2182. Strains of the test cultures were received from the collection of microorganisms of the Institute of Biology and Biotechnology the (University of Rzeszow, Poland). According to the ability of LAB strains to form lactic acid, L. lactis IMAU32258 was the best acid-forming agent with an acid-forming energy of 94 degrees T. E. faecium was characterized by moderate levels of active and titratable acidity. Less pronounced acid-forming ability was determined for the species E. durans and L. garvieae. Cultures of the genus E. faecium, L. garvieae and E. durans were the most resistant to high concentrations of NaCl (6.5%). Regarding temperature optimums, we found that strains of E. faecium and E. durans species grew both at temperatures of 10, 15 and 45 degrees C, whereas no growth of L. lactis IMAU32258 and L. garvieae JB282647 2 was observed at 45 degrees C. Among the studied bacteria, the strains of E. durans FMA8 and E. faecium L3-23 were characterized by the highest antagonistic activity in producing the largest zones of growth inhibition and optic density of pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms. The strain L. garvieae JB282647 2 exhibited the lowest level of antagonistic activity against pathogenic and opportunistic microorganisms.",,,2519-8521,2520-2588,,2020,11,4,10.15421/022089,,"*16S rRNA sequencing, RAPD–PCR and RFLP–PCR",No,Isolate,Yes,Whole mass,Culture,NA,Culture-based selective enumeration of LAB,NA,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Ukraine,NA,Bryndza and Budz,NA,Ripened,Commercial,NA,NA,NA

Physicochemical composition and NSLAB identification analyses were performed using both conventional and molecular methods. According to the results of a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, 13 different species belonging to seven genera were identified. Enterococcus faecium (38.42%) and E. faecalis (18.94%) were dominant species during the cheese manufacturing process, surviving 12 months of ripening together with Lactobacillus paracasei (13.68%) and Lb. plantarum (11.05%). The results indicate that NSLAB contributes to the microbiological stability of Ezine cheese over 12 months of ripening.

LAB were isolated from 80 samples of cheese collected from the markets of Erzurum. Antimicrobial activities of the isolates were determined using agar spot and well diffusion methods. LAB that showing antimicrobial activity were characterized phenotypically and genotypically, and the bacteriocin-producing strains were determined. The susceptibilities of bacteriocins to different temperatures, pH and enzymes were tested. While 48.29% of the 381 LAB isolated from cheese samples had antimicrobial activity, only 4.35% of them were determined producing bacteriocin. While 168 of 184 isolates which were showing antimicrobial activity were identified by phenotypical methods at a genus level, and 11 of were at a species level, 135 of 184 isolates were identified by genotypical methods at a genus level, and 26 of were at a species level.

For this purpose, mesophilic (n=526) and thermophilic (n=413) LAB isolates were collected from 34 raw milk and 16 cheese samples. 27 LAB isolates with a high autolytic activity ranging from 34 to 54 % were identified by (GTG)(5) fingerprint and 16S rDNA sequence analyses, which showed that Lactococcus lactis and Enterococcus faecium were abundant among the autolytic isolates in raw milk while E. faecium and Lactobacillus casei were in white-brined cheese. The autolysis rate of LAB strains increased by raising the temperature and pH; however, decreased somewhat at high NaCl concentrations. Additionally, the highest autolysis was observed in the presence of glucose for most of the strains. On the other hand, Lb. plantarum PFC231 was autolyzed differently, being the highest in the presence of lactose. E. durans PFC235, E. faecium PFC232 and Lb. plantarum PFC231 were autolyzed more than other LAB strains, when exposed to low pH, high NaCl concentration at 10 degrees C simultaneously. However, only Lb. plantarum PFC231, Leuconostoc mesenteroides PFC234, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris PFC233, Pediococcus acidilactici PFC237 and Lb. rhamnosus PFC238 were able to show intracellular caseinolytic activity. In conclusion, Lb. plantarum PFC231 has the potential to be used as an adjunct starter culture in the production of white-brined cheeses because of its autolysis at low temperature, pH and high salt concentrations, as well as intracellular caseinolytic activity.","Gursoy, Oguz/A-5615-2016",,0026-704X,,OCT,2018,68,4,10.15567/MLJEKARSTVO.2018.0407,,*16S RNA sequening for LAB,No,Isolate,Yes,Whole mass,Culture,NA,Selective plating and enumeration of LAB,NA,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Turkey,NA,White-brined cheeses,NA,Ripened,Commercial,No,No,NA

Methods and ResultsBrazilian cheese was used as source of LAB capable of hydrolysing main milk allergens. Proteolytic isolates were submitted to RAPD-PCR for the characterization of clonal diversity. Optimized hydrolysis was strain and protein fraction dependent. 16S rDNA sequencing identified three proteolytic strains: Enterococcus faecalis VB43, that hydrolysed (S1)-, (S2)- and -caseins, -lactalbumin and -lactoglobulin (partial hydrolysis), and Pediococcus acidilactici VB90 and Weissella viridescens VB111, that causedpartial hydrolysis of (S1)- and (S2)-caseins. Enterococcus faecalis VB43 tested negative for virulence genes asa1, agg, efaA, hyl, esp, cylL(L) and cylL(S) but positive for genes ace and gelE. Ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid inhibited the proteolysis, indicating that the main proteases of E. faecalis VB43 are metalloproteases. ConclusionBrazilian artisanal cheese is a good source of LAB capable of hydrolysing allergenic proteins in milk.

This study focused on the isolation and characterization of metabolically active populations of bacteriocinogenic LAB and the evaluation of their antimicrobial substances as well as of some nutritional requirements of them. One hundred and fifty colonies of LAB from artisanal cheeses produced in Minas Gerais state (Brazil) were isolated and screened for their antimicrobial activity. According to their activity against Listeria monocytogenes, ten strains were selected and subsequently identified using biochemical and molecular techniques including 16s rRNA amplification and sequencing as Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus spp., and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Antimicrobial substances produced by four of the selected strains, P. pentosaceus 63, P. pentosaceus 145, P. pentosaceus 146, and P. pentosaceus 147, were biochemically characterized, and presented sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes (suggesting their proteinaceous nature) and to extreme pH. Antimicrobial activity showed stability after treatment with lipase, catalase, alpha-amylase, and chemicals. Growth kinetics of the P. pentosaceus selected showed maximal bacteriocin production at 37 A degrees C during the end of the exponential growth phase (25,600 AU/mL) and stable production during 24 h of incubation. Dextrose, maltose, and a mixture of peptone, meat extract, and yeast extract increased bacteriocin production.

For this purpose, culture depended and 16S rRNA based culture independent methods were used. According to the results of culture depended method, Lactococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp. and yeast-mold were detected in all samples at different levels. In order to determine and identify both of the culturable and non-culturable microorganisms, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method was used. DGGE results have shown that there were eight different dominant microorganisms (Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis subs. lactis, Streptococcus infantarius subs. infantarius, Lactobacillus gallinarum, Streptococcus equinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus garvieae) in three regionally cheese samples. Further more, total bacterial loads were monitored with real-time PCR (qPCR) method. According to the results, 3.5 x 10(8), 3.8 x 10(8), 8.4 x 10(8) copy number of DNA was detected in C1, C2 and C3 cheese samples, respectively.

As a low fat cheese; it is a promising food in particularly for old people and whom suffering from obesity related diseases. The objective of this work was to isolate, identify and select Lactococcus lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditional Karish cheese to conserve and enhance the characteristics of conventional Karish cheese made of pasteurized milk to meet the new regulations for dairy production. Two Lactococcus strains were selected out of 11 Lactococcus LAB isolates from 15 Karish cheese samples, phenotypically and technologically characterized then identified using genotypic 16S rRNA approach. The two unique strains; L. lactis subsp cremoris (KM746) and the exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strain L lactis subsp lactis (KM721) were applied as single starter cultures in comparison with commercial starter culture used in Karish cheese making. Selected LAB showed decent growth throughout processing and storage at 4 degrees C for 10 days preventing growth of coliform and staphylococci. Chemical composition of tested cheese samples was similar to the conventional Karish cheese, whilst rheological and sensorial properties were enhanced which encourage recommending these strains as starter cultures conserving and enhancing this type of traditional cheese.

Identification to species and strain level was accomplished by 16S rRNA gene and PFGE analysis. Carbohydrate utilization profiles were obtained with the relevant API kits. Isolates were evaluated according to safety and technological criteria. The most frequently observed genus identified by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis was Enterococcus, whereas API system mostly identified Lactobacillus. The highest percentages of antibiotic resistance were to nalidixic acid (95%), and aminoglycosides (64-87%). All isolates were sensitive to several beta-lactam antibiotics and negative for histamine and DNase production. Gelatinase activity was detected in 49.1% of isolates, 43% were able to degrade casein and 93% were a-hemolytic. Most enterococci presented virulence genes, such as gelE, asal, ace. Diacetyl production was found to be species dependent and one strain (Leu. citreum) produced exopoly-saccharides. Selected strains were further studied for technological application and were found to be slow acid producers in milk and experimental cheeses, a desirable trait for adjunct cultures. Two strains were selected on the basis of technological and safety application as adjunct cultures in cheese production and presented the best cheese aroma and flavor in consumer preference tests. This is the first effort to characterize Pico cheese LAB isolates for potential application as adjunct cultures; the results suggest the potential of two strains to improve the quality of this traditional raw milk product.

Samples from rind and heart of Maroilles cheese were used, the LAB were selected on MRS agar at 30 degrees C and 197 Gram-positive and catalase-negative strains were subjected to identification by MALDI-TOF MS profiling. All strains were unambiguously identified: 105 strains from Maroilles made with raw milk (38 on the rind and 67 in the heart) and 92 strains from Maroilles made with pasteurized milk (39 on the rind and 53 in the heart). MALDI-TOF MS identification allowed identification of three genera belonging to LAB including Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Leuconostoc. Lactobacillus was the most represented genus with seven species: Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), L. paracasei, L. curvatus, L. rhamnosus, L. fnictivorans, L. parabuchneri, L. brevis found in Maroilles made with both kind of milk. The correlation between the 16S rDNA-based identification performed on selected strains and those obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS demonstrates that this fast, economically affordable, robust and reliable method for bacteria characterisation stands as an attractive alternative to the commonly-used methods and its application in food industry is discussed.

Samples of Minas artisanal cheese were collected at the farms in the region of Araxa, Brazil, over two seasons. Molecular approaches were used to assess the biodiversity of the isolates. The median value of the counts of LAB ranged from 6.4 to 9.5 log units in cheeses throughout the ripening period, in both seasons. The genera of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Pediococcus, and Lactococcus were found. L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus were the prevailing species during both seasons, suggesting they may play a role in the development of the cheese attributes. Enterococcus rivorum was identified in one sample and it was probably the first description in cheeses. This is an important report describing the varieties of LAB in this cheese and the identification of its lactic communities could be a source of strains with specific properties.","NUNES, ALVARO CANTINI/F-1703-2017; Sandes, Savio/A-7977-2013; Souza, Marcelo/ABF-5754-2020","NUNES, ALVARO CANTINI/0000-0001-8844-8333; Sandes, Savio/0000-0001-6157-8197; Souza, Marcelo/0000-0001-7071-7304; Silva, Jose Givanildo/0000-0001-5565-7980; Goulart de Oliveira, Leticia/0000-0001-8920-6571",1947-6337,1947-6345,,2017,15,1,10.1080/19476337.2016.1219392,,*16S rRNA gene sequencing for LAB,No,Isolate,Yes,Whole mass,Culture,NA,Selective plating and enumeration of LAB ,"1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, and 57 days of ripening",Yes,Whole mass,No,No,33,NA,NA,Brazil,NA,Minas artisanal cheeses,NA,Ripening,Industrial,Yes,Local,NA

From 179 LAB isolates obtained, 151 (84%) were capable to produce at least one of these vitamins. The average production of total folate and riboflavin in vitamin-free media was 138 ng/ml and 364 ng/ml, respectively. Based on RAPD-PCR and 16S rDNA sequencing, 19 different genetic profiles were obtained and 7 species were identified, with predominance of Streptococcus thermophilus (7), Weissella paramensenteroides (6), and Lactococcus lactis (4). Seven isolates that produced folate and riboflavin above the average were tested for vitamins production in UHT goat milk. Five isolates were capable to increase four to six fold the original amount of folate in the milk in 24 h. Folate content in milk fermented with Lc. lactis FP368 for 24 h was 313 ng/ml that could provide 19% of the recommended daily intake of this vitamin.

Classical biochemical tests, SDS-PAGE and 16S rRNA gene sequencing used for species assignation, showed that Lb. brevis and Lb. paracasei were the predominant species. RAPD-PCR and PFGE analysis of the 48 isolates of predominant species distinguished 21 genotype fingerprints, revealing a high genotypic heterogeneity. The examination of the technological properties of lactobacilli showed a significant (P<0.05) variation, in respect of their acidification and proteolytic activity. Genotypic clustering of lactobacilli and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of their technological properties indicated that lactobacilli are associated with their particular production dairy ecosystem. Overall, polyphasic characterization of lactobacilli isolated from mature cheese, based on genotypic and phenotypic data, provides solid basis for understanding their distribution and their functional significance and may be used as a tool to select strains appropriate as adjuncts cultures.

Ninety-three presumptive bacteriocinogenic strains were detected by direct antagonism assays and 29 of them were active against Enterococcus faecalis NRRL-B537, Listeria innocua 062 AST, or Listeria monocytogenes ATCC19115 by the well diffusion test using cell-free supernatants, adjusted to pH 6.0 to exclude inhibition by organic acids. Positive isolates were identified by partial sequencing of the 16s rDNA as Pediococcus acidilactici (four isolates), Enterococcus faecium (17 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (six isolates) and Lactobacillus fermentum (two isolates). RAPD-PCR discriminated seven groups with a 50% similarity and revealed the presence of the same isolates. The coding genes for the synthesis of plantaricin EF, plantaricin JK, plantaricin N, plantaricin NC8 and the inducing peptide plantaricin A were detected by PCR in L. plantarum. Similarly, enterocin P and pediocin PA-1 genes were amplified from Enterococcus and Pediococcus genomic DNA, respectively. Overall, co-culturing of bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains with the dairy starter Lactococcus lactis IPLA947 did not interfere with milk acidification. Lactose consumption, acidification rate and production of lactic acid were unchanged. Nonetheless, higher levels of acetic acid, ethanol and succinic acid were detected depending on the strain.

Subsequently, characterization of probiotic properties of LAB was studied by final pH, acidification, and amount of EPS concentration and aggregation properties. EPS productions by the strains were found between 54.1-93.6 mg/l. The highest EPS production was detected in the Pediococcus pentosaceus EC18 and the lowest EPS were estimated in the Enterococcus faecium EC26.

API 50 CH carbohydrate fermentation panels indicated strain WDC04(T) could only utilize one of the 50 substrates tested, ribose, although it does slowly utilize galactose. In the API ZYM system, strain WDC04(T) was positive for leucine arylamidase, valine arylamidase, cysteine arylamidase (weakly), naphthol-AS-BI-phosphohydrolase and beta-galactosidase activities. Total genomic DNA was sequenced from strain WDC04(T) using a whole-genome shotgun strategy on a 454 GS Titanium pyrosequencer. The sequence was assembled into a 1.90 Mbp draft genome consisting of 105 contigs with preliminary genome annotation performed using the RAST algorithm (rast.nmpdr.org). Genome analysis confirmed the pentose phosphate pathway for ribose metabolism as well as galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and glycerol fermentation pathways. Genomic analysis places strain WDC04(T) in the obligately heterofermentative group of lactobacilli and metabolic results confirm this conclusion. The result of genome sequencing, along with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, indicates WDC04(T) represents a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus wasatchensis sp. nov. is proposed.

L.",Potential of Lactobacillus curvatus LFC1 to produce slits in Cheddar cheese,FOOD MICROBIOLOGY,"Defects in Cheddar cheese resulting from undesired gas production are a sporadic problem that results in significant financial losses in the cheese industry. In this study, we evaluate the potential of a facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli, Lactobacillus curvatus LFC1, to produce slits, a gas related defect in Cheddar cheese. The addition of Lb. curvatus LFC1 to cheese milk at log 3 CFU/ml resulted in the development of small slits during the first month of ripening. Chemical analyses indicated that the LFC1 containing cheeses had less galactose and higher levels of lactate and acetate than the control cheeses. The composition the cheese microbiota was examined through a combination of two culture independent approaches, 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis; the results indicated that no known gas producers were present and that high levels of LFC1 was the only significant difference between the cheese microbiotas. A ripening cheese model system was utilized to examine the metabolism of LFC1 under conditions similar to those present in cheeses that exhibited the slit defect. The combined cheese and model system results indicate that when Lb. curvatus LFC1 was added to the cheese milk at log 3 CFU/ml it metabolized galactose to lactate, acetate, and CO2. For production of sufficient CO2 to result in the formation of slits there needs to be sufficient galactose and Lb. curvatus LFC1 present in the cheese matrix. To our knowledge, facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli have not previously been demonstrated to result in gas-related cheese defects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lactobacilli were then screened for some technological properties such as rapid and adequate production of lactic acid, growth in different salt concentrations, gas production from carbohydrates, catalase activity and antimicrobial activity. Finally, the selected lactobacilli were tested for their growth profile in a fluid model-medium modified according to the special conditions of fermented sausages. LSCD5, LSCD7, LSCD10, LSCD11 and LSCD14 showed high acidifying activity, and reduced the pH of MRS broth medium to similar to 4.0 in 24 h at 30 degrees C and in 48 h at 20 degrees C. These strains were identified by biochemical and molecular methods (16s rDNA sequencing) as Lactobacillus plantarum. The screened lactobacilli, except LSCD11, were able to grow at a high salt concentration of 10%. They also showed antimicrobial activities against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Relatively acceptable souring properties and good growth properties in simulated fermented sausage (SFS) medium were found for LSCD7 and LSCD14, with maximum numbers of 7.21, and 7.99 log CFU/ml, respectively. As a result, LSCD7 and LSCD14 exhibited the best technological properties to act as starter cultures for manufacturing fermented meat products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to characterize the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) growing on MRS medium, of TMM-cheese at the end of the ripening. Ninety-five LAB were isolated and genotypically characterized by Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) with two primers, species-specific PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The 95 LAB clustered in 70 biotypes. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus paracasei were the dominant species. Isolates were tested for their growth properties, carbohydrate metabolism, acidifying ability, proteolytic and lipolytic activities, acetoin production, aminopeptidase (AP) activity, biogenic amines production, bile salts hydrolysis, conjugated linoleic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid production. Lb. paracasei isolates resulted to be well adapted to Malga environment and to show the best AP activity and acetoin production. TMM-cheese related LAB showed also interesting health promoting properties and produced bioactive substances. In particular, one Lb. brevis biotype produced a GABA mean value of 129 mg/L that is considered a high concentration. The results confirmed that TMM-cheese resident LAB could be exploited for dairy production. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 oC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese. Practical Application Water buffalo mozzarella cheese, a typical Italian cheese, is traditionally produced using whole raw milk and natural whey cultures as starters. Its area of production, environmental conditions, traditional tools, and manufacturing processes grant unique sensory properties to the cheese, and these factors are consequently associated with the quality of the product. The isolated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) present in water buffalo mozzarella cheese include species of Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus. Enterococcus species were dominant. The elucidation of the LAB diversity enables a better understanding of their role in cheese quality.","Casella, Tiago/D-3600-2012; De Dea Lindner, Juliano/L-7802-2014; Nogueira, Mara C L/A-6944-2013; Penna, Ana Lucia B/AAN-3569-2020; Gomes-Pepe, Elisangela/C-4003-2013; Penna, Ana Lucia B B/G-4969-2013","Casella, Tiago/0000-0002-1596-2734; De Dea Lindner, Juliano/0000-0002-6191-8910; Gomes-Pepe, Elisangela/0000-0003-4401-3869; Penna, Ana Lucia B B/0000-0001-6715-9276; Nogueira, Mara Correa Lelles/0000-0002-6070-7716",0022-1147,1750-3841,FEB,2015,80,2,10.1111/1750-3841.12771,25597646,*16S rRNA sequencing for LAB,No,Isolate,Yes,Whole mass,Culture,"HE793101.1, KC456368.1, HM05859.1, NR075032.1, KC166144.1, HM218732.1, HMR18413.1, JN675227.1, JN675227.1 and HM218732.1",selective plating and enumeration of LAB,28 days of ripening,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Italy,NA,Water buffalo mozzarella cheese,NA,Ripening,Industrial,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, fast and accurate methods for identification and characterization of the microbial populations are of fundamental importance to the cheese industry. In this study, we investigate the application of the automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) for the assessment of the microbial dynamics in cheeses differing in salt cation level and type. We developed a database of the observed and theoretical length of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer of common lactic acid bacteria (LAB) found in cheese and used the database to describe the structure and dynamics of microbial populations during ripening. Salt content and cation concentration did not significantly influence the overall bacteria structure, except that lower salt levels resulted in enhanced starter survival. Presence of nonstarter LAB was detected by ARISA and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) after 3 months for all the cheeses analysed.

Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The addition of autochthonous starter cultures can ensure stability without compromising the characteristics of the final product. This study aimed to characterise the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) population in Vastedda della valle del Belice cheeses, which have a protected designation of origin (PDO) status, in order to develop an ad hoc starter culture to be used in its future production. Winter and spring productions were analysed to ensure isolation of specific LAB that had adapted to perform fermentation at low temperatures. Plate counts revealed total microbial numbers nearing 109 CFU.g(-1). All of the cheese samples were dominated by coccus-shaped LAB. When enterobacteria were present, their concentrations were at similar levels (3.3-5.6 Log CFU.g(-1)) in both seasons. All of the colonies that differed in morphological appearance were isolated and differentiated on the basis of phenotypic characteristics and genetic polymorphisms, as analysed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 74 strains were identified and further genotyped by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, resulting in the identification of 16 LAB species belonging to five genera (Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Streptococcus). The species most frequently present were Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The 74 strains were also investigated in vitro for general dairy parameters such as acidification capacity, diacetyl generation and antibacterial activity. Several strains of the most frequently represented species displayed traits relevant to the production of PDO Vastedda della valle del Belice.","Gaglio, Raimondo/M-2136-2016","Gaglio, Raimondo/0000-0002-2080-0836; Cruciata, Margherita/0000-0002-8484-7131; Di Gerlando, Rosalia/0000-0001-5135-6531; Portolano, Baldassare/0000-0003-0792-9405",1958-5586,1958-5594,MAR,2014,94,2,10.1007/s13594-013-0150-5,,*16S rDNA sequencing of LAB,No,Isolate,Yes,Whole mass,culture,KC545881–KC545901 and KF147882–KF147890.,Selective plating and enumeration of LAB,Ripened,No,Whole mass,No,No,NA,NA,NA,Italy,NA,"Vastedda della valle del Belìce” cheeses,",NA,Ripened,Commercial,No,No,NA

A total of 188 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates of Golija cheeses were obtained from seven samples of different ripening time. Phenotype-based assays as well as rep-PCR and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for all 188 LAB strains. The most diverse species were isolated from 20-day-old BGGO8 cheese (Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus sucicola, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by. diacetylactis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans and Leuconostoc mesenteroides). In other Golija cheeses Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus thermophilus and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides were found. Pronounced antimicrobial properties showed enterococci (13/42) and lactococci (12/31), while the good proteolytic activity demonstrated lactococci (13/31) and lactobacilli (10/29).","Kojic, Milan/I-4528-2019","Kojic, Milan/0000-0001-5645-750X; Golic, Natasa/0000-0001-7419-9743; Fira, Dorde/0000-0002-8773-8213",0354-4664,1821-4339,,2014,66,1,10.2298/ABS1401179T,,*16S rDNA sequencing of LAB,No,Isolate,Yes,Whole mass,culture,NA,Selective plating and enumeration of LAB,Ripened,No,Whole mass,No,No,12.5,NA,NA,Serbia,NA,artisanal Golija,180,Ripened,Industrial,No,No,NA
